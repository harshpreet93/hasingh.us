Hi, I'm Harshpreet. I'm a Software Engineer working in the San Francisco Bay Area. I love playing around with different technologies. At the moment, I'm especially interested in distributed systems, observability, static typing, Single Page Apps, Webassembly, PaaS, SaaS, and basically any technology that promises to increase productivity and leads to safer systems.

Some of the most interesting things I've worked on in the past is a [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) built on top of Kubernetes to enable greater developer velocity, safety, and autonomy, a feature-flagging/configuration management system for rapidly iterating on application changes.
